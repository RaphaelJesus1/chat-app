## Technical specifications
The app uses firebase as backend. It uses the services below:
* Authentication (for login)
* Storage (to store users image)
* Firestore database (to store chat messages)
* Messaging (to send push notifications) 

## Getting started
1. At first, you need to install flutter in your computer. Access the [Official Flutter Documentation](https://flutter-ko.dev/get-started/install) and follow the steps related to your OS.

2. You'll need to setup your firebase project credentials to run this app. You can access the link below to configure it by yourself.

Follow the step by step from the first step to the second command of the third step. This way you will configure the connection to your firebase project.
https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios#install-cli-tools

4. After configuring firebase, you'll need to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) (for Android) or [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (for iOS) to simulate the devices that you'll use to interact with FlutterChat. iOS devices can only be simulated in MacOS.

5. Run the simulator you installed in previous step and execute the command below inside of your project folder in terminal to run the application.
```bash
flutter run
```
